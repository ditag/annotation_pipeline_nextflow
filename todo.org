* DONE

- [X] orthofinder
- [X] alignments of each orthogroup with mafft
- [X] reconstruction of a phylogeny for orthogroups with more than 3 sequences with iq-tree
- [X]

* TODO

- [X] identify single copy orthogroups (accept missing data)
- [X] write core orthogroups with accessions as headers
- [X] concatenate core orthogroups
- [X] build phylogeny with fasttree
- [X] execute interproscan for each faa
- [X] execute blast vs SwissProt for chunks of 1000 sequences
- [X] execute blast vs COG for chunks of 1000 sequences
- [ ] execute plast/mmseq2 vs RefSeq for chunks of 1000 sequences
- [ ] execure gblast vs TCDB for chunks of 1000 sequences
- [ ] execute PRIAM for each genome
- [ ] execute macsyfinder for crispr
- [ ] execute macsyfinder for capsule
- [ ] execute macsyfinder for secretion systems
- [ ] execute eggnog-mapper
- [ ] get mapping to uniparc
- [ ] exact match to eggnog? /home/tpillone/work/dev/bio_databases/tri/sqlite/seq_db_eg.db
- [ ] uniclust
- [ ] extract best swissprot and refseq hits for each sequence (from database), build phylogeny with non-redundant set of BBH (3 refseq + 3 swissprot?) 

- BLAST vs PLAST vs mmseq2 vs diamond?
